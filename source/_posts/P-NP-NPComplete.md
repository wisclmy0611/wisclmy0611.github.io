# Definition

p problem: a problem can be solved in polynomial time

np problem: a candidate answer given to the problem can be tested in polynomial time

np-complete: 

1. prove np
2. reduce to an np complete



# Lemma

(8.1) Suppose Y ≤P X. If X can be solved in polynomial time, then Y can be
solved in polynomial time.

(8.2) Suppose Y ≤P X. If Y cannot be solved in polynomial time, then X
cannot be solved in polynomial time.
