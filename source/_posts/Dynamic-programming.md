**Dynamic Programming 动态规划**

​        Unfortunally, not all problems can come to an optimal solution by greedy algorithm. Sometimes, there are no natural greedy algorithm works. When facing exponential search, we can use a powerful technique, dynamic programming.

​        dynamic programming can simply described as dividing a problem into a series of subproblems, and then building up correct solutions to larger and larger subproblems (like brute-force search).
