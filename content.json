Sometimes, there are no natural greedy algorithm works. Compared to divide and conquer, when facing exponential search, we can use a powerful technique, dynamic programming. ​ Dynamic programming can simply described as dividing a problem into a series of subproblems, and then building up correct solutions to larger and larger subproblems (like brute-force search). ​ 不是所有问题都能用贪心算法解决，我们可以尝试动态规划。动态规划就是把一个问题分成一系列子问题，然后把解向更高一级子问题增进。（类似穷举法） Recursive Procedure Weighted Interval Scheduling first do recursive procedure building up solutions to larger and larger subproblems Objective: Maximize the total weight of tasks to be scheduled. ————— $u_1$ = 2 ​ ——————— $u_2$ = 4 ​ —————— $u_3$ = 4 ​ ———————————————————— $u_4$ = 7 ​ —————————— $u_5$ = 2 ​ ———————————— $u_6$ = 1 $u_1, u_3,u_5$: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 suppose that the tasks are sorted in nondecreasing finish time. we define $p(j)$ to be the largest index $i &lt; j$ that $i$ is the leftmost interval ends before $j$ begins. If no such request, $p(j) = 0$. consider an optimal solution $O$. If the last interval n is an element of $O$, then there are no interval between $p(j)$ and $j$ can belong to $O$. Also, $O$ must include an optimal solution of requests {1, …, $p(n)$}, because if didn’t, we could replace the choice of requests with a better one. ————— $u_1$ = 2 p(1) = 0 ​ ——————— $u_2$ = 4 p(2) = 0 ​ —————— $u_3$ = 4 p(3) = 1 ​ ———————————————————— $u_4$ = 7 p(4) = 0 ​ —————————— $u_5$ = 2 p(5) = 3 ​ ———————————— $u_6$ = 1 p(6) = 3 If $n$ isn’t an element of $O$, then $O$ equals to the optimal solution to the problem {1, …. n-1}. Thus, for any value of $j$ between 1 and $n$, let $O_j$ denote the optimal solution to the problem {1, …, j}, and let OPT(j) denote the value of the solution. OPT(0) =0. OPT(j) = max ($v_j$ + OPT(p(j)), OPT(j-1)) —— either n belongs to $O$ or not ​ Algorithm: 123456Compute — Opt(j) if (j = 0) return 0; Else return max(U_n + Opt(P(N)), Opt(n-1))End Proof: References: Kleinberg, J.
