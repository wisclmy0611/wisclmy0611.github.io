Sometimes, there are no natural greedy algorithm works. Compared to divide and conquer, when facing exponential search, we can use a powerful technique, dynamic programming. ​ dynamic programming can simply described as dividing a problem into a series of subproblems, and then building up correct solutions to larger and larger subproblems (like brute-force search). 不是所有问题都能用贪心算法解决，我们可以尝试动态规划。动态规划就是把一个问题分成一系列子问题，然后把解向更高一级子问题增进。（类似穷举法） Recursive Procedure Weighted Interval Scheduling first do recursive procedure building up solutions to larger and larger subproblems Objective: Maximize the total weight of tasks to be scheduled. ————— $u_1$ = 2 ​ ——————— $u_2$ = 4 ​ —————— $u_3$ = 4 ​ ———————————————————— $u_4$ = 7 ​ —————————— $u_5$ = 2 ​ ———————————— $u_6$ = 1 $u_1, u_3,u_5$: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 References: Kleinberg, J.
